# Conav

A code-navigation utility.

Currently supports Header switching and splitting for C++ via
`:ToggleSourceHeader` and `:SplitSourceHeader`. Additionally the utility
functions `:FileSearch` does a `ctrl+p`-like search from your working directory
while `:FileSearchCurrent` does a `ctrl+p`-like search relative to the active
buffer.
